                <p>At birth, infants are able to distinguish between contrastive phonemes in any of the worldâ€™s languages, but within a few months this capability is diminished in favour of the contrasts in those languages in their immediate environment (Kuhl et al., 1992). These contrasts, and other aspects of the ambient language(s), are acquired implicitly, without significant effort or formal teaching, and without conscious awareness of the acquired rules.</p>
                <p>Similarly, young children seem capable of more precise tonal perception and discrimination than adults (Trehub, 2003), and naturally pick up aspects such as melodic and harmonic features and constraints of the music around them without the need for instruction (Rohrmeier & Rebuschat, 2012). While musicians with formal training may have a conscious grasp of these rules, this understanding is not necessary to enjoy or even create music.</p>
                <p>In fact, newborn babies recognise melodies they were exposed to in the womb (Partanen et al., 2013), as well as the sounds of ambient languages (Moon et al., 2013). This means that the processes of auditory analysis and memory begin well before birth.</p>
