                <h2>Longevity</h2>
                <p>Some of the oldest human artifacts found have been musical instruments (Turk et al 2018), and it is reasonable to assume that vocal music preceded their invention. The continued existence of musicality over tens of thousands of years, as well as its presence as one of the earliest forms of technology, is good evidence for the innateness of the musical faculty.</p>

                <p>A flute made from a bear femur, about 55,000 years old, found in Slovenia. This item is likely to have been made by Neanderthals, since modern humans only arrived in Europe several thousand years later. This also suggests that musical ability also existed in the LCA.</p>
                <p>While we only have physical evidence for language as far back as the first written languages, unrecorded language is thought to have existed for at least 150,000 years (Perreault & Matthew, 2012).</p>

                <h2>Universality</h2>
                <p>Like language, music is present in all cultures in some form, and almost all musics share certain elements of construction, such as steady rhythms (isochronicity) and the use of a relatively small inventory of pitches (Ben√≠tez-Burraco & Nikolsky, 2023).</p>
                <p>Lab experiments using iterated learning have observed the development of some of these features over generations, including isochronicity, hierarchical organisation and use of rhythmic motifs (Ravignani et al., 2016).</p>
