                <p>In the absence of integrated words, music on its own does not have the type of logical compositional meaning that language has. However, it can be used to express other types of meaning; for example, it can be capable of powerful emotional expression, to the extent that some theories link its evolution to emotional regulation (Benítez-Burraco & Nikolsky, 2023).</p>
                <p>Other meanings can arise through the cultural contexts in which the music is used. For example, it is common for Western film scores and operas to include leitmotifs, short musical motifs that indirectly refer to specific characters, locations or themes as they appear in the story, or in order to draw the listener’s thoughts to them. In this form, musical items almost function like words, referring to expressible concepts even in their absence, albeit in a more temporarily constructed scenario. On a larger scale, individual pieces of music can come to denote specific culturally defined concepts such as group identities (for example, national anthems ) or festivals (wedding marches).</p>
                <p>The semantic content of music is even measurable in experimental settings. A study using brain imaging showed that musical excerpts were as effective as linguistic stimuli at producing a priming effect for target nouns (Koelsch et al., 2004). While music and language clearly do contain the same type of semantics, this may indicate that they are capable of forming comparable meaning relations.</p>
