                <h2>Inventories</h2>
                <p>Every spoken language has a phonemic inventory, that is a culturally determined repertoire of sounds that can be combined to produce a speech signal. These inventories can vary a lot between languages, and are learned during early childhood as part of the acquisition process.</p>
                <p>Similarly, inventories of musical notes and the intervals between them are also culturally specified; for example, Western music divides an octave into 12 semitones, the smallest allowable interval, whereas the Indian music system subdivides the same octave into 22 shruti (Kak, 2001). In both cases, smaller sets of notes of relative intervals are generally used for individual pieces.                </p>

                <h2>Categorical Perception</h2>
                <p>When hearing language, continuous differences in the production of phonemes are often perceived as belonging to one of several categories. For example, variation in voice onset time might lead an English speaker to consistently categorise a phoneme as /t/ or /d/, but not as being in between the two (Kessinger & Blumstein, 1997).                </p>
                <p>Musicians also tend to categorise continuous differences according to their native musical scale; for example, a Western musician might perceive an interval as either an augmented fourth or a perfect fifth, two intervals that vary by a semitone, but will not usually identify it as being in between the two (Burns & Ward, 1974).                </p>
